# Portfolio
This is my personal website which features code example, websites and applications that I have developed over the years. It is done on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Node JS) using some data from the WP API. I am in the process of move tha data over to mongoDB to get rid of WordPress entirely. I am also building a tool/ CMS in react and Express to manage the data in Mongo.

This project is under construction. You can view the existing WP version here http://craigbauer.nyc
