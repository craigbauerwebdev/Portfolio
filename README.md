# Portfolio
This is my personal website which displays code, websites and applications that I have built. It is developed in React JS with wordpress being used as a headless css and includes node/express for api endpoints. I will eventually move tha data over to mongo to get rid of WordPress and build a toll to manage the projects in Mongo.

This project is under construction. You can view the existing one here http://craigbauer.nyc
